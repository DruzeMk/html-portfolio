<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Experienced Civil Engineer with a demonstrated history of working in the construction industry. 
  Skilled in AutoCAD, Civil3D, Plateia, SAP2000, Revit, and Tekla Structures. 
  Strong engineering professional with a Master's degree focused on Civil Engineering from University 'Sv. Kiril I Met√≥dij' in Skopje.</p>

<p>I like new challenges, so I decided to start learning programming. It looks very interesting to me, the good side of it all is that I love computers so 
  I hope that learning full stack will be interesting and easy for me, I hope.</p>

<p>My desire is to become a good civil engineer, but I will use 
  programming for good things, maybe it will draw me deeper so that 
  I can work and earn a living. If nothing else, I will at least use it to 
  grow a construction business. Therefore, focus to the end, 
  and success is guaranteed, only the one who gave up lost.</p>
